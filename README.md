# Portfolio
A good way to make yourself known in the world of programming is to create a portfolio. It is really good when all of your impressive achievements, skills, and samples are collected in one place. If you know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can even publish your portfolio on the website you created yourself! This project is a great way to present yourself as a specialist.

You will write a one-page site with its own design and interactive elements. You will learn how to make your site adaptable to different screen sizes and browser versions. In the process, you will build your confidence in working with HTML.

## Stages
**Stage 1/5: Simple page**\
Everyone needs to start somewhere: why not start by making a simple web page with your bio and some examples of your work!

**Stage 2/5: Making a site**\
Divide the existing HTML code into sections and write markup for the site's header, navigation bar, block with the contact data, and footer.

**Stage 3/5: Adding styles**\
Presentation is everything: it is time to decide on the design of your website. Use CSS to implement your most daring ideas.

**Stage 4/5: Pop-up windows**\
You probably want to accompany your work with some comments. In this stage, you will create pop-up windows with information about each of your projects.

**Stage 5/5: Adaptability and cross-browser compatibility**\
Make the navigation bar convenient for browsing on smartphones and check that all the elements are displayed correctly on devices with different screen sizes and browsers.
